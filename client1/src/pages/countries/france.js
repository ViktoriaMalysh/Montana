              the history behind the country without doing any research. This
              incredible country deserves more research before you travel there

              Besides having the best taste in fashion and beautiful
              architecture, there are things you must understand before meeting
              the French face to face. An example of this is that the French
              find it very respectful to be greeted in French. Imagine if you
              went to France not knowing that! You would not leave a good first
              impression in your wake. Read through these interesting facts
              about France and familiarize yourself with the culture before
              visiting the country of love.
